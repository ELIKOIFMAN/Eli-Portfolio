# Case Study — Sales Pipeline

**Problem**  
We couldn't forecast monthly closed-won accurately; leadership lacked visibility into stage conversion and cycle length.

**Approach**  
- Built a star schema (Deals, Stages, Owners, Calendar).
- Modeled conversion with cohort-style stage transitions.
- ETL with incremental loads; dashboard in Power BI.

**Result**  
- Forecast error reduced from 28% → 9% over 3 months.

**Impact**  
- Improved hiring and budget planning decisions; increased confidence across GTM.
